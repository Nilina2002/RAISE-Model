# Multi-Hop Reasoning Integration for RETRO Model

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive multi-hop reasoning system integrated with the RETRO model, addressing the limitation of single-hop retrieval by enabling fact chaining and iterative reasoning across multiple knowledge chunks.

## Problem Statement

The original RETRO implementation had a significant limitation:
- **Single-hop retrieval only**: `query_retro.py` retrieves top-k chunks based on similarity
- **No fact chaining**: Retrieved chunks are processed independently without connecting related facts
- **No iterative reasoning**: No mechanism to refine queries based on intermediate findings
- **Limited context integration**: Chunks are processed in isolation rather than as interconnected knowledge

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Multi-Hop Reasoning System (`multihop_reasoning.py`)

**Key Components:**
- **KnowledgeGraph**: Graph-based representation of medical knowledge chunks with semantic and entity-based relationships
- **QueryExpander**: Expands queries based on retrieved information for iterative reasoning
- **ReasoningEngine**: Core reasoning engine for multi-hop inference
- **MultiHopReasoningSystem**: Main system integrating all components

**Features:**
- Graph construction with semantic similarity and entity relationships
- Iterative query expansion and refinement
- Multi-hop retrieval with reasoning paths
- Reasoning step tracking and confidence scoring

### 2. Enhanced Query System (`enhanced_query_retro.py`)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Hop Reasoning

```python
from scripts.multihop_reasoning import MultiHopReasoningSystem

# Initialize system
reasoning_system = MultiHopReasoningSystem()

# Perform multi-hop reasoning
result = reasoning_system.reason(
    query="What are the treatment options for diabetes and how do they relate to blood pressure management?",
    max_hops=3
)

print(f"Final Answer: {result.final_answer}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
print(f"Reasoning Steps: {len(result.steps)}")
```

### Enhanced Query System

```python
from scripts.enhanced_query_retro import EnhancedRetroQuery

# Initialize enhanced query system
query_system = EnhancedRetroQuery()

# Single-hop retrieval (backward compatible)
single_hop_result = query_system.retrieve("diabetes treatment", top_k=5)

# Multi-hop reasoning
multi_hop_result = query_system.reason("diabetes treatment", max_hops=3)

# Compare approaches
comparison = query_system.compare_approaches("diabetes treatment")
print(f"Coverage improvement: {comparison.improvement_metrics['coverage_improvement']:.3f}")
```

### Multi-Hop RETRO Model

```python
from scripts.retro_multihop_model import RETROMultiHopSystem

# Initialize multi-hop RETRO system
retro_system = RETROMultiHopSystem()

# Generate with multi-hop reasoning
result = retro_system.generate_with_reasoning(
    query="What are the treatment options for diabetes and how do they relate to blood pressure management?",
    max_hops=3
)

print(f"Response: {result['response']}")
print(f"Reasoning Steps: {result['reasoning_steps']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.3f}")
```

### Evaluation

```python
from scripts.reasoning_evaluation import ReasoningEvaluator

# Initialize evaluator
evaluator = ReasoningEvaluator()

# Evaluate reasoning path
metrics = evaluator.evaluate_reasoning_path(reasoning_path, ground_truth="...")

print(f"Path Coherence: {metrics.path_coherence:.3f}")
print(f"Evidence Relevance: {metrics.evidence_relevance:.3f}")
print(f"Reasoning Efficiency: {metrics.reasoning_efficiency:.3f}")
```
